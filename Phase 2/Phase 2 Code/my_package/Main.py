"""
Bank Transaction System Main Program
-------------------------------------

Overall Program Intention:
    This program simulates a simple bank transaction system. It allows users to log in as either
    an admin or a standard user and perform various transactions such as withdrawals, deposits,
    transfers, paying bills, and more. The system updates bank account records and logs transactions
    using fixed-width text files.

Input Files:
    - CBA.txt: A fixed-width text file containing current bank account records.
              Each line represents an account with fields for account number, account holder's name,
              account status, and current balance.
              
Output Files:
    - BAT.txt: A fixed-width text file where finalized transaction records are stored.
    - temp_bat.txt: A temporary file used during a session to store transaction records until logout.
    
How the Program is Intended to be Run:
    1. Ensure that CBA.txt exists in the same directory as the program.
    2. Run the program from the command line using Python 3:
           python Main.py
    3. Follow the on-screen prompts to log in as either an admin or standard user.
    4. Select transactions from the menu as desired. Standard users may have restrictions on certain
       transactions.
    5. When you choose to log out, any transaction data stored in temp_bat.txt is processed and appended
       to BAT.txt.
