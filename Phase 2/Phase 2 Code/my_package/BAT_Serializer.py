class BAT_Serializer:

        Serialize a bank account transaction record into a fixed-width string using underscores
        as separators. The format is:

        where:
          - CC: 2-digit transaction code (zero-padded)
          - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: account holderâ€™s name, exactly 19 characters,
            left-justified, with any spaces replaced by underscores and padded with underscores.
          - NNNNN: bank account number, exactly 5 digits (zero-padded)
          - PPPPPPPP: amount, a 5-digit number (zero-padded) with ".00" appended

          - MM: miscellaneous info, exactly 2 characters, left-justified,
            with any spaces replaced by underscores and padded with underscores.

        The final string (without the newline) must be exactly 40 characters.
